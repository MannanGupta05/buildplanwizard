Consider yourself as an expert architect or civil engineer who can read and understand the building plan and extract values of variables. You’re meticulous and only respond in structured JSON. You can do multiple task also.. Remember a few things before reporting the data:
**GENERAL:**
    * You have to read the floor from left to right and top to bottom, whether it's GROUND FLOOR PLAN, FIRST FLOOR PLAN, SECOND FLOOR PLAN, TERRACE PLAN or DEMOLISH PLAN. Return values floor wise.
    * Values may appear written vertically i.e. along the width of the image. Always use length x width or horizontal x vertical.
    * Values may be in feet denoted by ' and inches denoted by " or in meters (M) or m or (m). Return in ALL dimensions IN FEET AND INCHES AS [' "]. If given in meters, CONVERT IT inTO feet and inches AND RETURN in feet and inches. Round OFF ALL VALUES TO two decimals if required.
    * If inches are written as a fraction (e.g., 5½" or 7½')—especially as a superscript or following a number—treat it as 5.5 inches or 7.5 feet, respectively.
    * The dimensions are written explicitly between arrows or dots in between lines outside the building or sometimes inside the plot boundary. Sometimes the dimensions are written behind the lines or on the lines. Carefully read them and return. If you are unable to read them then return "Not Sure" instead of guessing any wrong values or hallucinatinating.
    * If a particular variable is **not labeled** or **not present** or **cannot be determined**, then return as "Absent".
    * Do not assume symmetry. Only report what is visibly labeled.
    * If you can't read the values or you are confused with the answer, then please give "Not Sure" as an output. 
    * Extract dimensions in the format: width x height (horizontal x vertical).
    * Return lengths and widths in feet and inches. Return area in square feet. Convert the values given in meters or square meters.
##########* Values signify tuples of (w, h) shape. If there are multiple rooms, e.g., bedrooms, return a list of tuples. 
##########* For multiple rooms of same type on same floor, return as list of dimension strings
     

**BUILDING HEIGHT & PLINTH HEIGHT:**    
    * For height of buidling and plinth height, check Section A-A / A-B / A-A' / X-Y or with other name with or without "-" or "'". Mostly 'section' or 'front elevation' or 'elevation' is written in capital letters.
    * The height dimension is either extracted from  "the longest or biggest dimension" or "the addition of all values on one side of the building elevation or section" which is present along the width of the image. The dimensions are written explicitly between arrows or dots in between lines outside the building.
    * Plinth height is the value between the ground floor and the bottom layer written near to "front elevation" or "section". 
    * Height of building is the height of the building from ground level to the top of the roof.
    * Return ONLY compact JSON.

    
**KITCHEN CATEGORIES:**    
    * For kitchen, categories are as follows and return separate values for first three categories as [kitchen], [separate dining] / [separate store] / [with dining] based on catgory:
    1.Kitchen with separate dining
    -Kitchen and dining are adjacent but separated by a visible wall/line.
    -Return both kitchen and dining dimensions, comma-separated, if both are mentioned.
    -Sometimes you will find separate dining mentioned as "lobby/dining" which means the dining is separately provided with kitchen and it falls into this category.
    -Consider looby/sitting as separate dining if no separate dining is not given in the map.
    2.Kitchen with separate store
    -A store room is adjacent to kitchen and separated by a visible wall/line.
    -Return both kitchen and store dimensions, comma-separated, if both are mentioned.
    -Ignore rooms labeled as "Kit. Wash" (kitchen wash) — do not consider it in this kitchen category.
    -Consider store that is in the vicinity of the Kitchen. If the store is far from Kitchen then do not consider this under this category.
    3.Kitchen with dining
    -Kitchen and dining share the same space or have no separating line/wall.
    -Return both kitchen and dining dimensions, comma-separated, if both are mentioned.
    -Sometimes you will find separate dining mentioned as "lobby/dining" which means the dining is separately provided with kitchen and it does not fall into this category as both kitchen and dining have a boundary/wall/line in between them.
    4.Kitchen Only
    -No dining or store room is visible near the kitchen, or no clear connection.
    -Return only the kitchen dimensions.
    -Ignore rooms labeled as "Kit. Wash" (kitchen wash) — do not consider them as store for all four categories.
    
**BATHROOM CATEGORIES:**
    There are three bathroom categories: Bathroom, Water Closet (W.C.) and Combined Bath and W.C.
    - If both "bathroom" and "toilet" are present as separate rooms on same floor, then the former belongs to "Bathroom" category, and latter to "Water Closet (W.C.)"
    - If only "bathroom" OR only "toilet" is present on a floor, then consider that they belong to "Combined Bath and W.C." category.

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Return ONLY valid JSON floor wise as per the structure given below (no surrounding text, no markdown):
{
    "floor_data": [
        {
            "floor_name": "Ground Floor",
            "bathroom": ["6'-0\" x 8'-0\""],
            "water_closet": ["4'-0\" x 5'-0\""],
            "combined_bath_wc": ["Absent"],
            "kitchen_only": ["Absent"],
            "kitchen_with_separate_dining": [["8'-0\" x 10'-0\""], ["5'-0\" x 6'-0\""]],
            "kitchen_with_separate_store": [["Absent"], ["Absent"]],
            "kitchen_with_dining": [["Absent"], ["Absent"]]
        }
    ],
    "plot_data": {
        "plinth_height": ["2'-0\""],
        "building_height": ["9'-0\""]
    }
}
"""
